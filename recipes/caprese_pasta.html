  <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>I love making this pasta recipe all year round, but I especially love it when I have fresh basil and cherry tomatoes in the garden. Thereâ€™s no better way to put it to good use than with this amazing recipe.</p>
    <p>The tomato cream sauce is so flavorful, and has a combination of Parmesan and melty mozzarella, which pairs perfectly with fresh tomatoes and basil. Juicy seared chicken makes it a complete meal, which you can even drizzle with a little balsamic glaze for the ultimate Caprese flair!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 large boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>Salt/Pepper</li>
    <li>1/3 cup flour</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol> 
      <li>Prep Work: Combine the half and half, chicken broth, and seasonings</li>
      <li>Cook the Chicken: Cut the chicken in half lengthwise to create 2-3 thinner slices.</li>
      <li>Begin to heat a pot of salted pasta water while you begin to prepare the sauce as outlined below.</li>
      <li>Add the wine to the same skillet that you used to cook the chicken and set the heat to medium.</li>
      <li>Add the butter and garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the combined half and half mixture in small splashes, stirring continuously.</li>
      <li>Gradually sprinkle in the Parmesan cheese, stirring continuously. </li>
      <li>Add the drained pasta and stir to combine. Add the chicken strips and let it warm through for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Garnish with basil, whole leaves or chiffonade (shredded/finely cut). Serve!</li>
    </ol>
